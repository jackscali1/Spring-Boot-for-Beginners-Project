# Spring Boot for Beginners Project

This project is a full-stack Java application that I built while completing the **Spring Boot for Beginners** certification from Amigoscode.  
It covers real-world backend development using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and basic AI integration with OpenAI.

## What I Learned

- Building REST APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with Spring Boot
- Creating layered architecture (controllers, services, repositories)
- Database integration with Spring Data JPA and PostgreSQL
- ORM (Object Relational Mapping) with Hibernate
- Configuring projects with `application.properties`
- Handling exceptions in APIs
- Managing dependencies with Maven
- Integrating OpenAI with Spring AI
- Setting up Docker for local database environments
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

## Tech Stack

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.4.4
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL
- Maven
- OpenAI API (Spring AI)
- Docker

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/jackscali1/Spring-Boot-for-Beginners-Project.git
   
2. Set up your application.properties file with your database and OpenAI credentials.

3. Run the application:
./mvnw spring-boot:run

5. Access the REST API at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/software-engineers
